## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a student in the **BEKUP Create** program held by the Ministry of Creative Economy, partnered with Dicoding Academy. <br> 
Although Plant Science is my main academic background, I am keen on improving my skills in computer science-related fields because I hope one day to bring these two knowledge together to solve the pressing issues occurring within food supply and crop production systems.
